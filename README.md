# Time-to-schedule-my-work-day

## Description

I bulit a workday (9-5) scheduler using CSS, HTML, Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap.
This will help the working individual to better plan their workday, as well as have a clear knowledge of what they need to accomplish in their day!

Here is the link to my deployed application:
https://afaidley.github.io/Time-to-schedule-my-work-day/

## Usage

Usage of my Workday Scheduler is simple- you just need to click on the corresponding time and add the required task in the text field, once you have completed adding it, simply press the save button and it will be saved to local storage so even if you refresh your page it will stay! Grey means that the time is in the past, red is the present and green is the future. You will be able to find the current time located on the top of the app.
Thank you for using my app!
